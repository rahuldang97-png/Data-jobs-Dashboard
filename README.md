## Introduction

The project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard intended for the analysis of the data jobs market in 2024. It provides an overview of the availability of the job openings, salary trends, job distribution by role, as well as global demands. In addition, it highlights the substantial differences between job titles such as Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Business Analyst, Cloud Engineer, as well as Senior-level positions, thus giving users a comprehensive view of the data job landscape.

The goal behind this project lies in providing actionable insights for job seekers, recruiters, and analysts by visually representing critical job metrics such as salary, demand trends, and required skills.

-  🗺️ Map Analysis – displayed the global spread of jobs using map visuals.

-  🔢 KPI Cards & Tables – designed cards for key stats and tables for detailed comparisons.

-  🎨 Dashboard Design – focused on making the dashboard clean, intuitive, and visually engaging.

-   🖱️ Interactive Reporting:
    -   Slicers: To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
